# Final Mechanical Overview

<img src="assets/img/portfolio/Mechanical Design Icon.JPG" alt="No Fur Fox-Bot" width="100%" /><br>

Below is a full and then subsystem level illustration and discription of the mechanical side of the Fox-Bot. We chose Onshape as the CAD software to design in because of its colaboration feature. If you are looking for more details, or wish to recreate some or all of our Fox-bot, here is the link to view our [Onshape document](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/1b48057a8a815e53d3545e9e/w/6e1c3f24dad80367486a2603/e/9e2e6a22bfb83421378f1be2)*. Most real life images are in the mechanical design process page.

*This is a full CAD rendering of the Fox-Bot. The whole design is modular and almost all joints are either press fits or bolts. Only the castor wheels, the depth of which needed to exactly match the motorized wheels, are wood glued.*

## Chassis

*CAD rendering and drawings of the chassis. All of these parts are \frac{1}{4}'' plywood and machined with a laser cutter.*

## Electrical Management

*CAD rendering and drawings of the battery container and PCB housing. The battery container is \frac{1}{4}'' plywood machined with a laser cutter. The PCB Housing was 3D printed from PLA.*

## Face

*CAD rendering and drawings of the eye display mounts, nose, and camera mount. All drawn parts are \frac{1}{4}'' plywood machined with a laser cutter. Included in the CAD rendering are CAD aproximations of the eye displays and camera and its board*

## Ears

*CAD rendering and drawings of the ear scafolding, ear motor mounts, and ear motor horn. All drawn parts are \frac{1}{4}'' plywood machined with a laser cutter. Included in the CAD rendering are CAD aproximations of the small servos used to power the ears*

## Tail

*CAD rendering and drawings of the tail pieces, tail horn, and tail servo mounts. All drawn parts were printed with PLA. Included in the CAD rendering are CAD aproximations of the servo used to power the tail. The live image shows the final integrated tail.*

## Asthetics

*Images of the 4 main peices of fur that cover the body, ears, and tail of the Fox-Bot, CAD for the Minecraft Sweet Berry, and a physical rendition of the sweet berry made of stacked layers of wood glued \frac{1}{4}'' plywood machined with a laser cutter. This Prop is what the camera tracked after the Beastling Call melody is recognized by the microphone (built into the board the camera is on).*
